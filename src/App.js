With the best study material.Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use by typesetters since the 16th century.

<h2>All genuine Documentation at one place</h2>
<p id="p2">Being Geeky helps the viewer to find all the required documentation at one place so that they need not waste time to find offical documentation. The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the layout.</p>

While in earlier times several lines of the Lorem Ipsum text were repeated in the creation of dummy texts, today the full text of Ciceros De finibus serves as the basis for many dummy text or Lorem Ipsum generators. Based on De finibus, these generators automatically create longer sections of the Lorem Ipsum text or various other filler texts.</p>

<p id="p4">You can watch the lecture anytime from anywhere and ask doubts.The phrasal sequence of the Lorem Ipsum text is now so widespread and commonplace that many DTP programmes can generate dummy text using the starting sequence "Lorem ipsum". Fortunately, the phrase 'Lorem Ipsum' is now recognized by electronic pre-press systems and, when found, an alarm can be raised. This avoids a publication going to print with overlooked dummy text.</p></div>
